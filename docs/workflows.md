# System Workflows

Runtime data flows that span multiple components. Read this before
implementing any feature that connects to existing code.

For development process (how to work), see `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
For feature requirements, see `specs/`.
For build order, see `docs/plan.md`.

## Android Build Verification

Before calling an Android integration runnable, verify the build path that
forces generated-code wiring to execute.

- If a feature introduces Room, Hilt, or another KSP-backed library, the
  owning Android module must declare both the runtime dependency and the
  matching compiler/plugin wiring.
- `:app:assembleDebug` is the minimum verification step for Android runtime
  wiring. Pure JVM tests do not prove that generated classes such as
  `*_Impl` or DI components exist.
- Keep repository-specific Kotlin/KSP compatibility properties in place
  until the toolchain is upgraded and re-verified. Removing them can turn a
  compile-time wiring problem into a runtime crash.
- Treat "generated implementation does not exist" failures as build wiring
  bugs first, not runtime-only bugs.

## Screenshot Import (v1)

Full pipeline from camera capture to saved record.

### Pipeline

```
Screenshot Intake → Template Validation → OCR/Field Mapping
→ Normalization → Draft Creation → Review State → Save Validation
→ Record Persistence + Screenshot Linkage
```

### Stage Details

**1. Screenshot Intake & Local Storage**

- User captures or selects screenshot
- Save to app-managed local storage (not external)
- Generate a stable reference ID for linkage through the pipeline
- **Output:** `ScreenshotRef(id, localPath, timestamp)`
- **Error:** Storage write fails → show error, do not proceed. Do not
  silently discard the screenshot.

**2. Template Validation**

- Match screenshot against known templates
- **Input:** `ScreenshotRef`
- **Output:** `TemplateMatch(templateId, confidence)` or rejection
- **Error:** No template matches → reject with clear message to user
  ("Unsupported screenshot format"). Do not attempt partial parsing.
- **Error:** Low confidence match → flag for user confirmation before
  proceeding. Do not auto-accept.

**3. OCR / Result Mapping**

- Extract field values from screenshot using matched template
- Map extracted text to structured fields
- **Input:** `ScreenshotRef` + `TemplateMatch`
- **Output:** `RawFieldMap(Map<FieldKey, ExtractedValue>)`
- **Rule:** Do not invent values not visible in the screenshot
- **Rule:** Mark fields with low extraction confidence as unresolved
- **Error:** OCR extraction fails entirely → abort with error message.
  Do not create a draft with empty fields.

**4. Field Normalization**

- Clean and normalize extracted values (trim whitespace, standardize
  number formats, parse dates)
- Apply field-type-specific rules
- **Input:** `RawFieldMap`
- **Output:** `NormalizedFieldMap(Map<FieldKey, NormalizedValue>)`
- **Rule:** Normalization must be a pure function — testable without
  Android framework dependencies (JVM test target)
- **Error:** Normalization fails for a field → keep raw value, flag
  field as requiring manual review

**5. Draft Creation**

- Assemble normalized fields into a draft record
- Attach the `ScreenshotRef` for linkage
- **Input:** `NormalizedFieldMap` + `ScreenshotRef`
- **Output:** `DraftRecord(fields, screenshotRef, unresolvedFields, flags)`
- **Rule:** `unresolvedFields` must list every field that failed OCR,
  failed normalization, or had low confidence
- **Rule:** Draft is not yet persisted to Room — it exists in memory only

**6. Review State Generation**

- Generate review UI state from the draft
- Flag fields that need user attention
- **Input:** `DraftRecord`
- **Output:** `ReviewState(displayFields, editableFields, blockers)`
- **Rule:** If `unresolvedFields` is non-empty, at least one blocker
  must exist — the user must resolve before saving
- **Rule:** User can edit any field, not just flagged ones

**7. Save Validation**

- Validate the complete record before persistence
- **Input:** `ReviewState` (after user edits)
- **Output:** `ValidationResult(isValid, errors)`
- **Rule:** Block save when required fields are empty or invalid
- **Rule:** Validate field types, ranges, and required-field presence
- **Rule:** Save validation is a pure function (JVM test target)
- **Error:** Validation fails → show field-level errors in review UI.
  Do not navigate away. Do not clear user edits.

**8. Record Persistence & Screenshot Linkage**

- Write validated record to Room
- Maintain linkage between record and screenshot file
- **Input:** Validated `DraftRecord`
- **Output:** `SavedRecord(id, screenshotRef)` persisted in Room
- **Rule:** Persistence and screenshot linkage happen in a single
  transaction — if record save fails, do not orphan the screenshot
  reference
- **Rule:** After successful save, navigate to record list / confirmation
- **Error:** Room write fails → show error, keep user on review screen
  with all data intact. Do not lose edits.

### Cross-Cutting Rules

- Screenshot reference must be preserved from stage 1 through stage 8.
  If linkage breaks at any point, the record is invalid.
- No stage may introduce values not derived from the screenshot or
  user input. No invented data.
- No stage may introduce cloud, sync, or server-side OCR behavior.
  This is a local-first pipeline.
- Each stage should fail explicitly. Silent fallbacks hide bugs.

### Test Coverage Map

| Stage | Test Type | What to Test |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Intake | Instrumented | File storage, path generation |
| 2. Template validation | JVM | Match logic, rejection, confidence thresholds |
| 3. OCR mapping | JVM | Field extraction, unresolved marking |
| 4. Normalization | JVM | Pure transform logic, edge cases |
| 5. Draft creation | JVM | Field assembly, flag generation |
| 6. Review state | JVM + Compose | State generation, blocker logic, UI rendering |
| 7. Save validation | JVM | Required fields, type checks, range checks |
| 8. Persistence | Instrumented | Room write, transaction integrity, linkage |

## Record List Display

Flow from app launch to showing saved records.

1. App starts → `MainActivity` launches `RecordListScreen`
2. `RecordListViewModel` observes Room DAO via `Flow<List<SavedRecord>>`
3. Records load → UI shows list sorted by `createdAt` descending
4. Empty state → show empty message (not a blank screen)
5. User taps a record → navigate to detail screen with `record.id`

**Error path:**
- Room query fails → show error state in UI, allow retry
- Record has broken screenshot linkage → show record without thumbnail,
  do not crash

---

## Record Detail / Edit

Flow for viewing and editing a saved record.

1. `RecordDetailScreen` receives `record.id` via navigation
2. `RecordDetailViewModel` loads record from Room by ID
3. Display all fields + linked screenshot thumbnail
4. User taps Edit → switch to edit mode (same screen or sheet)
5. User modifies fields → local state only, not yet persisted
6. User taps Save → `SaveValidation.validate(editedRecord)`
7. Validation passes → update Room record
8. Success → exit edit mode, show updated record
9. Validation fails → show field-level errors, keep edit mode

**Error path:**
- Record not found by ID → navigate back, show error toast
- Screenshot file missing on disk → show record without image,
  do not block access to field data
- Room update fails → show error, keep edits intact

## Document Maintenance

Update this file when:

- A new end-to-end flow is implemented that spans 2+ components
- An error path is discovered that isn't documented here
- A handoff between stages changes (types, method signatures)
- A stage is added, removed, or reordered

Do not update this file for:
- Process changes (update CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)
- Feature requirements (update the spec)
- Build order changes (update docs/plan.md)
